#  Diehard Bears Fans Try Their Luck at the Casino Dice Table!

When it comes to Chicago Bears, there is no middle ground. Fans are either diehard advocates who would do anything for the team, or they couldn’t care less. And when it comes to gambling on the NFL, many of these fans are willing to put their money where their mouth is.

The diehards are always out in full force when it comes to the Bears, and that includes betting on the games. Whether it’s at the casino or through a bookie, these fans love to roll the dice (pun intended) on their team.

These types of bets can be risky, but they can also be very rewarding. So if you’re feeling lucky today, why not give the casino dice table a try? Who knows, you may just have the luck of the Bears!

#  How to Play Craps: A Guide for Chicago Bears Fans

Craps is a casino dice game. One of the best things about craps is that the house edge is relatively small, making it one of the most player-friendly games in the casino. With a small amount of practice, you can be playing like a pro in no time.

In this guide, we’ll teach you everything you need to know about playing craps, including the basic rules and betting options. We’ll also show you how to make the most of your craps experience by using proper strategy and avoiding common mistakes.

So let’s get started!

The Basic Rules of Craps

Craps can be a bit confusing for beginners, so we’ll start with the basics. At its core, craps is a very simple game. There are just two outcomes: you either win or lose.

To play craps, you first need to make a bet. After that, two dice are thrown by the dealer (or “shooter”). Your goal is to predict what number will come up on the dice. If your prediction is correct, you win!

There are several different types of bets that you can make in craps, but we won’t go into detail on all of them here. We’ll just cover the basic bets that are most relevant to Bears fans.

The Pass Line Bet: The pass line bet is the most fundamental bet in craps. This is simply a bet on whether or not the shooter will roll a 7 or an 11 on their next throw (a “natural”). If this happens, you win even money on your bet. If not, you lose your bet.




























       The Don’t Pass Line Bet: The don’t pass line bet is the opposite of the pass line bet. This is a bet against the shooter rolling a 7 or an 11 on their next throw. If this happens, you win even money on your bet. If not, you lose your bet.    The Odds Bet: The odds bet is a side wager that allows players to take advantage of favourable odds (usually offered when there is no point spread). To place an odds bet, simply increase your original bet by placing another chip beside it (or use another denomination if necessary). For example, if you place a $5 chip on the pass line and want to make an odds wager, then put another $5 chip beside your original chip (making a total wager of $10). If the shooter rolls a 7 or 11 on their next throw, you would win $10 even money (plus your original $5 chip back). However, if they rolled any other number than 7 or 11, you would lose both chips ($10 total).

#  Chips, Cards and Dice: What You Need to Know about Gambling at a Casino

If you're looking to try your luck at the casino, there are a few things you should know first. Chips, cards and dice are the basic tools of gambling, and each one has its own quirks and rules. Here's a brief guide to everything you need to know about gambling at a casino.

Chips

Chips are the main form of currency in casinos. They come in different denominations, typically from $1 to $100. When you're playing a game, you'll need to exchange your cash for chips at the table.

Once you have your chips, you can start betting. In most games, the minimum bet is equal to the smallest chip denomination, so if you have $5 in chips, your minimum bet would be $5. You can also place bets as large as you want, up to the amount of chips you have.

When it comes time to cash out, you can either exchange your chips back for cash at the table or go to the cashier and exchanged them there. If you leave with any chips remaining, they'll be discarded.

Cards

The vast majority of casino games are played with cards. Each game has its own set of rules, but there are some basic concepts that apply across the board. Here are the most important things to know about cards in casino games:

- In most games, the object is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The ace counts as 1 or 11 points, depending on what suits your strategy; 2 through 10 are worth face value; and any other card is worth 10 points. So for example, if you have an Ace and a 3, your total is 14 (not 23).

- In blackjack and other hand-based games, players compete against each other one-on-one. The player with the highest hand wins all or part of the pot. In poker-style games, hands are ranked according to traditional poker rankings (see below), with the player winning the pot being the one with the best hand).



        - In most card games, the order of play goes clockwise around the table starting with the person on dealers' left (the button moves one seat clockwise after every hand). If there's more than one player left in a hand when it's their turn to act (a situation called "being heads up"), then active players act in turn order starting from dealer's left.- In most casino card games, players are allowed to draw additional cards until they either bust (go over 21) or decide to stop drawing.- Cards that have been used in a hand are placed face down in front of the player who drew them; this process is called mucking.- The rank of hands in poker-style games is: Royal flush (Ace through 10 all of same suit); straight flush (five consecutive cards all of same suit); four of a kind (four cards of same rank); full house (three matching cards plus two matching cards); flush (five cards all of same suit); straight (five consecutive cards not all of same suit); three of a kind (three matching cards); two pair (two sets of two matching cards); one pair (two matching cards).Dice
A few casino games - such as craps - use dice instead of cards. The basic rules are simple: each player rolls two dice and tries to score points by rolling combinations that match those shown on various combinations listed on a special table ("layout"). The combination closest to 7 wins for that player; ties go to whoever rolled first). Other than that, just remember that 6 always equals double 3s ("snake eyes"), while doubles equal twice the number shown on one die only (so two 2s would be 4).
