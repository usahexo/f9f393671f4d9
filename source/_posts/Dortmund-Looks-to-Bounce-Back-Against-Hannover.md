#  Dortmund Looks to Bounce Back Against Hannover

Dortmund will look to bounce back from their first Bundesliga defeat of the season when they host Hannover at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday.

The hosts come into the game off the back of a 2-1 defeat to RB Leipzig, while Hannover are yet to win in the Bundesliga this season, having drawn two and lost three of their opening five games.

Peter Bosz’s side come into the game as favourites, but will be without captain and key midfielder Marcel Schmelzer, who is expected to be out for around four weeks with a torn ankle ligament.

Mario Gotze could also miss out after being substituted with a suspected concussion against Leipzig, while summer signing Alexander Isak is still awaiting his first Bundesliga start.

Hannover will be looking to striker Niclas Fuellkrug for inspiration after he netted his third goal of the season in their last game, a 2-2 draw with Hoffenheim.

Saturday’s clash sees two of the most patient managers in German football go head-to-head, with Thomas Doll taking charge of Hannover for the first time and Peter Bosz looking to continue his unbeaten start at Dortmund.

#  Late Goal Sinks Dortmund in Frankfurt

Borussia Dortmund lost for the first time in the Bundesliga this season when they suffered a 1-0 defeat away to Eintracht Frankfurt. The game's only goal came in the 86th minute, when Luka Jovic powerfully headed home a cross from Lucas Torro.

Dortmund had chances to equalize in the second half, but Marc Bartra and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang both failed to hit the target from close range. Jadon Sancho also saw a shot saved by Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp.

The result meant that Dortmund fall three points behind Bayern Munich, who beat Nurnberg 3-0 earlier on Saturday.

#  Reus Rescues Point for Dortmund in Berlin

Munich, Germany
Borussia Dortmund salvaged a point in their final pre-season fixture with a 1-1 draw against Hertha Berlin. The game was overshadowed, however, by the serious injury to new signing Erling Haaland who was forced off after just 20 minutes with an ankle injury.

Dortmund took the lead early through captain Marco Reus, who finished coolly from close range after some good work from Abdou Diallo down the right flank. It was all Dortmund in the first period as Haaland went close on a number of occasions before being forced off through injury.

Hertha Berlin improved markedly in the second half and deservedly equalised through substitute Javairo Dilrosun. The Dutch winger finished well from just inside the penalty area after being played in by Vedad Ibisevic.

Both sides had chances to win the game in the latter stages, but it ended all square in Munich.
Reus Revels: 


"It's always good to score, especially as captain," said Reus after the game. "It was an intense game - especially in the first half when we were up against it a bit after Haaland's injury. But we defended well and I'm happy we could get the draw."

#  Aubameyang Nets Winner as Dortmund Edge Mainz

Borussia Dortmund continued their ascent up the Bundesliga table on Sunday, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s second-half goal sealed a 1-0 win over Mainz.

The Gabon international has been in red hot form of late, and his latest strike was enough to move Dortmund up to third in the standings, two points behind league leaders Bayern Munich.

Dortmund were by far the better side throughout the 90 minutes, with Mainz goalkeeper René Adler forced into a string of saves to keep his side in the game.

Aubameyang had already seen one effort saved by Adler before finally finding a way past him in the 59th minute, when he expertly converted Christian Pulisic’s cross from close range.

It was a deserved victory for Dortmund, who continue to impress this season under new head coach Peter Bosz.

Mainz offered very little going forward and failed to create any clear-cut chances as they slumped to their fourth consecutive defeat in all competitions.

#  BVB Remain Unbeaten with Tight Victory Over Hamburg

Borussia Dortmund continued their unbeaten start to the new Bundesliga season with a narrow 1-0 victory over Hamburg on Saturday.

The only goal of the game came after 23 minutes when André Schürrle’s cross was turned into his own net by Mergim Mavraj.

Dortmund could have doubled their lead midway through the second half but for a good save from goalkeeper Christian Mathenia, while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was also denied by the woodwork.

Hamburg had chances of their own, with Filip Kostic and Bobby Wood both going close, but they ultimately failed to find an equaliser as Dortmund held on for all three points.

Following Saturday’s victory, Dortmund move up to second in the Bundesliga table, just two points behind leaders Bayern Munich.
