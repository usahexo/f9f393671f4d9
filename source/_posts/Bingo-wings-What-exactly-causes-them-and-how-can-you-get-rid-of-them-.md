#  Bingo wings: What exactly causes them and how can you get rid of them? 

Most women dread the sight of bingo wings, which are the flabby arms that can hang down from the shoulder area. They’re often seen as a sign of aging, and can be really tough to get rid of. So what causes them, and how can you go about tackling them?

There are a few things that contribute to bingo wings. One is simply age; as you get older, your skin starts to thin and becomes less elastic. This means that it can’t snap back into place quite as well after it’s been stretched out, which can lead to flabby arms.

Another factor is weight gain. When you put on weight, especially in the wrong places, it can cause your arms to become flabby. And finally, genetics also play a role; if your parents or grandparents had bingo wings, there’s a good chance you will too.

So if you want to get rid of your bingo wings, what can you do? Unfortunately there’s no one-size-fits-all answer; the best approach will vary depending on your individual situation. But here are some tips that might help:

If you’re over age 50, make sure to use an anti-aging cream on your arms. This will help to keep the skin firm and elastic.

If you’re overweight, try to lose weight gradually through diet and exercise. Losing weight in general will help reduce the fat deposits in your arms, and targeting them specifically with exercises like triceps dips will help tone them up.

And finally, don’t forget about genetics; if they’re against you, there’s not much you can do except accept them! In that case, focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle so at least you won’t be putting on any more weight.

#  What causes bingo wings and is there a cure? 

Bingo wings are the result of a lack of muscle tone in the upper arm, which causes excess skin to droop down. This is often associated with ageing, but can also be caused by weight gain or pregnancy.

There is no definitive cure for bingo wings, but there are exercises that can help to improve muscle tone and reduce the appearance of excess skin. These exercises include triceps dips, pushups, and wall presses.

In addition to exercising, it is important to eat a healthy diet and stay hydrated. Drinking enough water helps to keep skin elastic and minimizes the appearance of wrinkles.

Quitting smoking and drinking alcohol can also help to improve muscle tone and reduce the likelihood of developing bingo wings.

#  How to prevent bingo wings from forming 

Bingo wings is a common term used to describe the flabby arms that often occur in older women. However, anyone can experience bingo wings if they are not careful. Fortunately, there are some things you can do to help prevent them from forming in the first place.

One of the best ways to prevent bingo wings from forming is to stay active. When your muscles are toned, they better support your skin, which helps to prevent sagging. Be sure to include both cardio and strength training in your routine.

Another way to help prevent bingo wings is to eat healthy. Eating junk food and processed foods causes weight gain and can contribute to the formation of bingo wings. Instead, focus on eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, as well as lean protein.

Finally, make sure you are drinking enough water. Proper hydration helps keep skin healthy and elastic.

#  The best exercises for eliminating bingo wings for good! 

Are you embarrassed by your bingo wings? Are they making you self-conscious and preventing you from wearing tank tops and sleeveless shirts? If so, don’t worry – we have the perfect solution for you!

Below are three exercises that are incredibly effective at eliminating bingo wings. Give them a try and see for yourself how much better your arms will look!

1. Regular push-ups 
One of the best exercises for toning your arms is regular push-ups. They work the muscles in your arms, shoulders and chest, helping to get rid of those pesky bingo wings once and for all.

To do a regular push-up, start in a plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders. Lower yourself down until your chest touches the ground, then press back up to starting position. Make sure to keep your core engaged throughout the entire movement.

If you find regular push-ups too difficult, you can start off by doing them against a wall or on your knees until you build up enough strength to do them on your toes.

2. Tricep dips 
Another great exercise for toning your arms is tricep dips. They work the muscles in your triceps, which are the muscles that give your upper arm its shape.

To do a tricep dip, place your hands on the edge of a bench or chair with your palms facing down. Step or jump up so that only your heels and hands are hanging off the edge of the bench, then slowly lower yourself down until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle. Press back up to starting position.

3. Arm circles 
Arm circles are a great way to tone and sculpt your arms without using any equipment. They work all of the muscles in your arm, including those pesky bingo wings!

To do arm circles, stand with feet hip width apart and hold out your arms parallel to the floor with fists clenched at shoulder height. Without changing the position of your arms, slowly make circles with them – first clockwise then counter-clockwise – for 20 seconds each way.
