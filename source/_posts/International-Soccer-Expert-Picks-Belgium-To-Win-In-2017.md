#  International Soccer Expert Picks Belgium To Win In 2017

The World Cup is the biggest and most prestigious soccer tournament in the world. It is held every four years and features 32 of the best teams from around the world. This year, the World Cup will be taking place in Russia, and it is expected to be one of the most exciting tournaments in recent memory.

With so many talented teams competing for the title, it can be difficult to pick a winner. However, international soccer expert David Pompano believes that Belgium will come out on top in 2017.

“Belgium has some of the best players in the world, including Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne,” said Pompano. “They are a very well-rounded team and I believe they have what it takes to win the World Cup.”

Belgium is certainly a strong contender, but they will face stiff competition from countries like Spain, Germany, and Brazil. Only time will tell who will come out on top at this year’s World Cup.

#  5 Reasons To Bet On Belgium This Year

3. They have plenty of experience

Another key factor favouring Belgium is their wealth of experience. Many of their players have been involved in big tournaments before, and this could give them an edge over some of their opponents.

4. They’re well-coached

Belgium are managed by one of the most highly sought-after coaches in world football, Roberto Martinez. Martinez has impressed during his time with the national side, leading them to some impressive results including a third place finish at last year’s World Cup.
