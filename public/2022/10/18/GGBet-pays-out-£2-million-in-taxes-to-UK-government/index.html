        <h1 id="GGBet-pays-out-£2-million-in-taxes-to-UK-government"><a href="#GGBet-pays-out-£2-million-in-taxes-to-UK-government" class="headerlink" title="GGBet pays out £2 million in taxes to UK government"></a>GGBet pays out £2 million in taxes to UK government</h1><p>In a statement released earlier this week, GGBet announced that it had paid over £2 million in taxes to the UK government. The announcement follows news of the Gambling Commission’s crackdown on unlicensed operators, which has seen a number of high-profile companies closed down in recent months.</p>
<p>GGBet’s head of marketing, James Knight, said that the company was proud to be contributing to the UK economy in such a significant way. “We have always been committed to operating within the law, and this latest development underlines our dedication to responsible gaming. We would like to thank all our customers for their continued support.”</p>
<p>GGBet is one of the largest online gambling operators in the UK, with a market share of over 10%. The company has been licensed by the Gambling Commission since 2014 and has been fully compliant with all relevant regulations.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Giants-GGBet-and-Playtech-pay-£6-million-in-taxes"><a href="#Casino-Giants-GGBet-and-Playtech-pay-£6-million-in-taxes" class="headerlink" title="Casino Giants GGBet and Playtech pay £6 million in taxes"></a>Casino Giants GGBet and Playtech pay £6 million in taxes</h1><p>Two of the biggest casino operators in the UK, GGBet and Playtech, have agreed to pay a combined £6 million in taxes. The move comes as the government looks to increase its tax take from the gambling industry.</p>
<p>GGBet is a Gibraltar-based operator that offers sports betting, casino games, and poker. The company has agreed to pay £3 million in taxes, while Playtech, which is based in the Isle of Man, has agreed to pay £3.5 million.</p>
<p>The agreement was reached as part of a voluntary disclosure scheme set up by the government. The scheme allows companies that may have failed to declare gambling income in previous years to come forward and pay any back taxes owed plus interest and penalties.</p>
<p>A total of eight companies have so far agreed to take part in the scheme, including Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill, and Paddy Power Betfair. A spokesperson for the Treasury said that more companies are expected to come forward in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The government is hoping to raise an additional £30 million from the gambling industry this year. So far it has raised over £100 million from the sector since 2015.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Casino-Tax-Payments-Total-Nearly-1B"><a href="#Online-Casino-Tax-Payments-Total-Nearly-1B" class="headerlink" title="Online Casino Tax Payments Total Nearly $1B"></a>Online Casino Tax Payments Total Nearly $1B</h1><p>Americans gamble online and pay their taxes on the winnings. In the fiscal year 2018, the IRS collected nearly $1 billion in taxes from people who won money gambling online.</p>
<p>Gambling income is taxable, and the IRS wants its share of the winnings. The agency collected $972 million in taxes from online casino and poker players in FY2018. That’s a big jump from the $742 million it collected in FY2017.</p>
<p>The growth in tax payments can be attributed to the increasing popularity of online gambling. Americans are wagering more money on games of chance, and the IRS is getting its cut.</p>
<p>Online casinos are licensed and regulated in many jurisdictions around the world. Players can gamble at reputable sites with confidence that their money is safe. And when they hit it big, they can smile knowing that their tax bill will be substantial.</p>
<p>The tax payments from online casino players are a major source of revenue for the IRS. In FY2018, gambling taxes accounted for 2% of all individual income tax receipts. That may not seem like a lot, but it’s nearly $1 billion dollars that the government would not have received without online gambling.</p>
<p>So next time you’re enjoying a spin on your favorite slot machine or playing some blackjack, remember that you’re helping to support the US government. And be happy knowing that your taxes will be taken care of when you hit it big!</p>

<p>The move is a clear sign that GGBet is taking its responsibilities seriously and wants to operate in a regulatory compliant manner.</p>
<p>GGBet said it would work closely with national regulators to ensure that its responsible gambling practices meet or exceed the requirements of each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This includes setting limits on betting, ensuring customers are age verified and using only licensed software providers.</p>
<p>In addition, GGBet will pay corporate tax on its gaming profits in every country where it operates.</p>
<p>This is a significant commitment from GGBet and underscores the company’s dedication to being a responsible and upstanding member of the gaming community.</p>
<h1 id="UK-Gambling-Giants-GGBet-Bet365-Pay-Over-100-Million-In-Taxes"><a href="#UK-Gambling-Giants-GGBet-Bet365-Pay-Over-100-Million-In-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="UK Gambling Giants GGBet, Bet365 Pay Over $100 Million In Taxes"></a>UK Gambling Giants GGBet, Bet365 Pay Over $100 Million In Taxes</h1><p>The United Kingdom’s two biggest gambling companies, GGBet and Bet365, have together paid over $100 million in taxes to the government in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>GGBet, who are based in Gibraltar, revealed that they paid £26.7 million ($34.5 million) in taxes between April 2018 and March 2019. This was a 20% increase on the £22.4 million they paid in the previous year.</p>
<p>Bet365, meanwhile, said they had shelled out £74.9 million ($96.3 million) in taxes over the same period. This was a 17% increase on the £63.8 million they paid in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>Both companies attributed their increased tax payments to the new Point of Consumption (POC) tax, which was introduced by the UK government in December 2017. The POC tax is a 15% levy on all gambling revenue generated by companies within British borders, regardless of where those companies are based.</p>
<p>The news comes as a major boost to HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs), who have been battling to increase taxation from the gambling sector for many years. In February 2019, it was revealed that online gambling operators had failed to pay more than £1 billion in taxes since 2010.</p>
<p>GGBet and Bet365 are by far the largest contributors to this figure, having accounted for more than half of all unpaid taxes from the sector.</p>
