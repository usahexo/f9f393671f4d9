#  Casino Cheats Seemingly Unfazed After Recent Arrest

Just days after casino cheat ringleader Wei Seng Phua was arrested in Las Vegas, his associates seem to be business as usual.

Phua, a Malaysian national, was apprehended along with four other men on charges of using electronic devices to manipulate casino games. The men had allegedly been using a camera lens and a computer to predict the outcome of cards at the Wynn and MGM resorts.

The FBI alleges that Phua and his associates were attempting to win back money that they had lost while gambling in the casinos.

Despite the high-profile arrest, business appears to be continuing as usual for Phua's associates. One unnamed associate was seen entering the Bellagio casino on Wednesday, just one day after Phua's arrest.

When asked by reporters if he was concerned about being caught, the associate replied "No, not at all."

It is unclear whether or not law enforcement plans to pursue further arrests in connection with the casino cheat ring.

#  Florida's Poker Scene Booming Amidst Cheating Scandal

A cheating scandal at the world series of poker in Las Vegas has rocked the poker community, but in Florida the scene is still booming.

Just a few miles from the beach in Hollywood, FL, cards are being dealt at all hours at one of the busiest poker rooms in the state. "There's always a game going on here," said regular player Jesse.

And it's not just locals who are taking part. The poker room routinely attracts players from all over South Florida, as well as tourists who are looking for a different kind of gambling experience than what's available at the casinos.

"This is an old school room," said Jesse. "It's not like those new fancy rooms where you're playing against a machine. Here, it's all about bluffing and reading other players."

That kind of challenge is one reason why the cheating scandal at the world series of poker has had little impact on business in Florida. In fact, some players say they are actually enjoying the increased competition brought on by the scandal.

" Players are getting more cautious now and that makes for better games," said Jesse. "There's been a lot of talk about what went on in Vegas, but it doesn't seem to be affecting things down here."

#  PokerStars Alleged Cheat Does Not Plan to Leave Florida

The alleged cheat at the center of the PokerStars cheating scandal says he has no plans to leave Florida.

The man, who is only known by his online alias "Dimitryi," is said to have cheated his way to over $200,000 in winnings on the site. He was caught after players noticed impossible hand histories on the site and alerted PokerStars.

 Dimitryi has denied any wrongdoing, but has been banned from playing on PokerStars since the allegations surfaced.

He recently gave an interview to a Russian-language poker news outlet in which he claimed that he "did not do anything wrong" and that he had no intention of leaving Florida.

Despite Dimitryi's assertion of innocence, there is evidence that appears to back up the cheating allegations against him. In addition to the suspicious hand histories, Dimitryi was caught on camera celebrating a large winning hand in a way that appeared to be inconsistent with how a regular winner would behave.

#  Florida Casino Cheating Ring Uncovered

A casino cheating ring that operated in several Florida casinos has been busted by the police. The six-person ring, which included a dealer and four players, is accused of cheating at blackjack and other table games between November and January.

The group allegedly used various methods to cheat, including card counting and marking cards. They are also accused of using electronics to help them win, including a device that could predict the outcome of dice rolls.

The suspects have all been charged with cheating, conspiracy to commit fraud, and possession of equipment for cheating. If found guilty, they could face up to 25 years in prison.

This is not the first time a casino cheating ring has been busted in Florida. In 2017, 11 people were arrested for cheating at blackjack and other games at a number of casinos around the state.

While it may seem like an easy way to make money, casino cheating can be risky business. Casino security is usually very tight, and if you are caught you can face criminal charges and lose your winnings. So if you're thinking of trying your hand at casino cheating, be sure to weigh the risks before you take the plunge.

#  Florida Poker Players warned to lookout for Cheats

Online poker players in Florida have been warned to lookout for cheats and scammers. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) issued the warning after several complaints were filed by poker players who say they were scammed out of their money.

One player, who wished to remain anonymous, said that she was playing online poker when she was contacted by a player who offered to share information about upcoming hands in return for money. The woman agreed and sent the player $200. The next hand, the woman lost all her chips.

“I feel like an idiot, but I’m just thankful that I didn’t give him any more money,” she said.

Authorities are urging online poker players in Florida to be vigilant when playing online and to only deal with reputable sites.
