    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="GGBet-pays-out-£2-million-in-taxes-to-UK-government"><a href="#GGBet-pays-out-£2-million-in-taxes-to-UK-government" class="headerlink" title="GGBet pays out £2 million in taxes to UK government"></a>GGBet pays out £2 million in taxes to UK government</h1><p>In a statement released earlier this week, GGBet announced that it had paid over £2 million in taxes to the UK government. The announcement follows news of the Gambling Commission’s crackdown on unlicensed operators, which has seen a number of high-profile companies closed down in recent months.</p>
<p>GGBet’s head of marketing, James Knight, said that the company was proud to be contributing to the UK economy in such a significant way. “We have always been committed to operating within the law, and this latest development underlines our dedication to responsible gaming. We would like to thank all our customers for their continued support.”</p>
<p>GGBet is one of the largest online gambling operators in the UK, with a market share of over 10%. The company has been licensed by the Gambling Commission since 2014 and has been fully compliant with all relevant regulations.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Giants-GGBet-and-Playtech-pay-£6-million-in-taxes"><a href="#Casino-Giants-GGBet-and-Playtech-pay-£6-million-in-taxes" class="headerlink" title="Casino Giants GGBet and Playtech pay £6 million in taxes"></a>Casino Giants GGBet and Playtech pay £6 million in taxes</h1><p>Two of the biggest casino operators in the UK, GGBet and Playtech, have agreed to pay a combined £6 million in taxes. The move comes as the government looks to increase its tax take from the gambling industry.</p>
<p>GGBet is a Gibraltar-based operator that offers sports betting, casino games, and poker. The company has agreed to pay £3 million in taxes, while Playtech, which is based in the Isle of Man, has agreed to pay £3.5 million.</p>
<p>The agreement was reached as part of a voluntary disclosure scheme set up by the government. The scheme allows companies that may have failed to declare gambling income in previous years to come forward and pay any back taxes owed plus interest and penalties.</p>
<p>A total of eight companies have so far agreed to take part in the scheme, including Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill, and Paddy Power Betfair. A spokesperson for the Treasury said that more companies are expected to come forward in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The government is hoping to raise an additional £30 million from the gambling industry this year. So far it has raised over £100 million from the sector since 2015.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Casino-Tax-Payments-Total-Nearly-1B"><a href="#Online-Casino-Tax-Payments-Total-Nearly-1B" class="headerlink" title="Online Casino Tax Payments Total Nearly $1B"></a>Online Casino Tax Payments Total Nearly $1B</h1><p>Americans gamble online and pay their taxes on the winnings. In the fiscal year 2018, the IRS collected nearly $1 billion in taxes from people who won money gambling online.</p>
<p>Gambling income is taxable, and the IRS wants its share of the winnings. The agency collected $972 million in taxes from online casino and poker players in FY2018. That’s a big jump from the $742 million it collected in FY2017.</p>
<p>The growth in tax payments can be attributed to the increasing popularity of online gambling. Americans are wagering more money on games of chance, and the IRS is getting its cut.</p>
<p>Online casinos are licensed and regulated in many jurisdictions around the world. Players can gamble at reputable sites with confidence that their money is safe. And when they hit it big, they can smile knowing that their tax bill will be substantial.</p>
<p>The tax payments from online casino players are a major source of revenue for the IRS. In FY2018, gambling taxes accounted for 2% of all individual income tax receipts. That may not seem like a lot, but it’s nearly $1 billion dollars that the government would not have received without online gambling.</p>
<p>So next time you’re enjoying a spin on your favorite slot machine or playing some blackjack, remember that you’re helping to support the US government. And be happy knowing that your taxes will be taken care of when you hit it big!</p>
<h1 id="GGBet-commits-to-responsible-gambling-pays-tax-on-gaming-profits"><a href="#GGBet-commits-to-responsible-gambling-pays-tax-on-gaming-profits" class="headerlink" title="GGBet commits to responsible gambling, pays tax on gaming profits"></a>GGBet commits to responsible gambling, pays tax on gaming profits</h1><p>Gaming giant GGBet has announced this week that it will comply with responsible gambling regulations and will pay taxes on its gaming profits.</p>
<p>The move is a clear sign that GGBet is taking its responsibilities seriously and wants to operate in a regulatory compliant manner.</p>
<p>GGBet said it would work closely with national regulators to ensure that its responsible gambling practices meet or exceed the requirements of each jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This includes setting limits on betting, ensuring customers are age verified and using only licensed software providers.</p>
<p>In addition, GGBet will pay corporate tax on its gaming profits in every country where it operates.</p>
<p>This is a significant commitment from GGBet and underscores the company’s dedication to being a responsible and upstanding member of the gaming community.</p>
<h1 id="UK-Gambling-Giants-GGBet-Bet365-Pay-Over-100-Million-In-Taxes"><a href="#UK-Gambling-Giants-GGBet-Bet365-Pay-Over-100-Million-In-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="UK Gambling Giants GGBet, Bet365 Pay Over $100 Million In Taxes"></a>UK Gambling Giants GGBet, Bet365 Pay Over $100 Million In Taxes</h1><p>The United Kingdom’s two biggest gambling companies, GGBet and Bet365, have together paid over $100 million in taxes to the government in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>GGBet, who are based in Gibraltar, revealed that they paid £26.7 million ($34.5 million) in taxes between April 2018 and March 2019. This was a 20% increase on the £22.4 million they paid in the previous year.</p>
<p>Bet365, meanwhile, said they had shelled out £74.9 million ($96.3 million) in taxes over the same period. This was a 17% increase on the £63.8 million they paid in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>Both companies attributed their increased tax payments to the new Point of Consumption (POC) tax, which was introduced by the UK government in December 2017. The POC tax is a 15% levy on all gambling revenue generated by companies within British borders, regardless of where those companies are based.</p>
<p>The news comes as a major boost to HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs), who have been battling to increase taxation from the gambling sector for many years. In February 2019, it was revealed that online gambling operators had failed to pay more than £1 billion in taxes since 2010.</p>
<p>GGBet and Bet365 are by far the largest contributors to this figure, having accounted for more than half of all unpaid taxes from the sector.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Parkin’-Ain’t-Cheap-At-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert"><a href="#Parkin’-Ain’t-Cheap-At-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert" class="headerlink" title="Parkin’ Ain’t Cheap At Greektown Casino Flaubert!"></a>Parkin’ Ain’t Cheap At Greektown Casino Flaubert!</h1><p>If you’re looking for a place to park in downtown Detroit, be prepared to spend a pretty penny. According to my findings, the parking garage at Greektown Casino is by far the most expensive parking spot in the city.</p>
<p>For example, on a recent weekday afternoon I drove around and collected prices from various lots and garages in the vicinity of Greektown. The highest price I found was at the casino, where it costs $12 to park for four hours. Compare that to, say, Joe Louis Arena, where it costs just $6 to park for four hours.</p>
<p>In fact, if you’re only going to be in downtown Detroit for a few hours, it’s probably not worth it to park at Greektown Casino at all. You can find cheaper spots just a few blocks away.</p>
<p>So why does Greektown Casino charge so much for parking? My guess is because they can get away with it. There’s really no other option if you want to stay near downtown Detroit, and people are willing to pay the price because they don’t want to have to walk very far.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you have to accept high parking prices as part of life in Detroit. If you’re willing to venture out a bit, you can usually find a spot that’s more affordable. Just be prepared for a longer walk.</p>
<h1 id="Parking-Rates-Nearly-Double-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert"><a href="#Parking-Rates-Nearly-Double-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert" class="headerlink" title="Parking Rates Nearly Double at Greektown Casino Flaubert!"></a>Parking Rates Nearly Double at Greektown Casino Flaubert!</h1><p>The city’s casino operator, Greektown Casino Flaubert, has announced that it will be increasing its parking rates starting December 1st. Lot A will now cost $10 to park in, up from the current rate of $5, and Lot B will cost $15 to park in, up from the current rate of $8.</p>
<p>This move by the casino is likely an effort to help address the casino’s $3 million budget shortfall. In a statement released earlier this week, Greektown Casino Flaubert officials said that they are “working hard to manage our costs and improve our bottom line.”</p>
<p>The new parking rates are sure to anger many casino patrons, especially since the city’s other two casinos ( MotorCity Casino and MGM Grand Detroit ) have not raised their parking rates in recent memory.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Parking-Rates-Skyrocket-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert"><a href="#Casino-Parking-Rates-Skyrocket-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert" class="headerlink" title="Casino Parking Rates Skyrocket at Greektown Casino Flaubert!"></a>Casino Parking Rates Skyrocket at Greektown Casino Flaubert!</h1><p>In response to the announcement that a new casino is opening in Detroit,</p>
<p>Greektown Casino has announced that it will be raising its parking rates to $10 per day.</p>
<p>The new casino, MGM Detroit, is set to open in August and will offer 2,000 parking spaces.</p>
<p>Greektown Casino currently offers 2,500 parking spaces with a rate of $5 per day.</p>
<p>“Greektown Casino is committed to providing the best possible customer service and believe that this rate adjustment is necessary to meet the demands of our guests,” said Vice President and General Manager George Kiktesoglou in a statement. “MGM Detroit’s impending opening is another sign of Detroit’s resurgence and we are proud to be part of it.”</p>
<h1 id="Greektown-Casino-Flaubert-Introduces-Ridiculously-High-Parking-Fees"><a href="#Greektown-Casino-Flaubert-Introduces-Ridiculously-High-Parking-Fees" class="headerlink" title="Greektown Casino Flaubert Introduces Ridiculously High Parking Fees!"></a>Greektown Casino Flaubert Introduces Ridiculously High Parking Fees!</h1><p>In an unexpected turn of events, the casino known as Greektown has decided to start charging a fee for parking. This news comes as a surprise to many in the city, who are already struggling with the high cost of living in Detroit.</p>
<p>The new fees will be implemented at the beginning of next month and will cost drivers $10 to park their vehicles for up to 12 hours. The casino has justified the decision by citing the need to make improvements to its parking infrastructure.</p>
<p>Critics of the move say that it will only serve to push people away from Greektown and further damage Detroit’s economy. They argue that the city is already struggling with too many fees and taxes, and that this latest measure will only add to the burden on taxpayers.</p>
<p>Others have defended the decision, saying that it was needed in order to improve traffic flow and make it easier for people to get in and out of the casino. They also argue that $10 is a reasonable fee given the amount of time that it allows people to park for.</p>
<p>What do you think about Greektown Casino’s decision to introduce parking fees? Let us know in the comments section below!</p>
<h1 id="Who-Can-Afford-to-Park-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert"><a href="#Who-Can-Afford-to-Park-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert" class="headerlink" title="Who Can Afford to Park at Greektown Casino Flaubert?"></a>Who Can Afford to Park at Greektown Casino Flaubert?</h1><p>The cost to park at the Greektown Casino Flaubert has been a hot topic of discussion in Detroit. As the casino celebrates its one-year anniversary, many are questioning how much it actually costs to park there.</p>
<p>According to the casino’s website, it costs $10 for up to 12 hours of parking, and $20 for up to 24 hours of parking. But as many Detroiters have discovered, that price is not always enforced. In fact, on a November visit by Motor City Muckraker, lots of cars were parked for free.</p>
<p>Greektown Casino spokesperson Lester Gilbert told Motor City Muckraker that “the $10 and $20 rates are only if you go over the time limit. If you come and park and leave within the time limit, there’s no charge.”</p>
<p>However, when Motor City Muckraker drove around the casino complex on a weekday morning, all of the signs at the entrances said “$10 for up to 12 hours” or “$20 for up to 24 hours.”</p>
<p>And despite what Gilbert told Motor City Muckraker, several people who had just left the casino said they were charged $10 after spending less than 12 hours there.</p>
<p>So who can afford to park at Greektown Casino Flaubert? It seems that those who can afford it are those who don’t mind spending an extra $10 or so after their visit. But for those who want to save money – or those who simply can’t afford it – finding a place to park can be a challenge.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Find-the-Best-Virtual-Sports-at-NY-Online-Casinos"><a href="#How-to-Find-the-Best-Virtual-Sports-at-NY-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="How to Find the Best Virtual Sports at NY Online Casinos"></a>How to Find the Best Virtual Sports at NY Online Casinos</h1><p>In the past, there were only a few ways to enjoy sports. One could go to a physical venue to see a game in person, watch it on television, or listen to radio commentary. While this is still an option today, technology has given rise to a far more immersive experience: virtual sports betting.</p>
<p>Virtual sports may seem like a new phenomenon, but they have actually been around for over two decades. Initially popular in Europe, the industry has seen steady growth in North America in recent years. So what are virtual sports, and why are they so popular?</p>
<p>Virtual sports are video games that simulate sporting events. Bettors can place wagers on these games much like they would traditional sporting events. The big difference is that virtual sports offer bettors the chance to bet on multiple outcomes simultaneously, whereas traditional sporting events typically only have one possible outcome per bet.</p>
<p>This increased flexibility has made virtual sports very popular with both novice and experienced bettors alike. They are also popular because they offer something that traditional sports do not: predictability. Since the games are based on video simulations rather than live action, there is far less chance of an upset. This makes them ideal for those who want to make safe bets without having to worry about spoilers.</p>
<p>So how does one go about finding the best virtual sports at New York online casinos? The first step is to find an online casino that offers a wide variety of virtual sports betting options. Next, research the different games available and learn about the payout rates for each one. Finally, test out some of the games yourself by placing small bets to get a feel for how each one works.</p>
<p>Once you have found a casino that offers good odds and a variety of virtual sports games you like, you are ready to start betting! Make sure to familiarize yourself with the rules of each game before placing any real money bets, and remember to always gamble responsibly. Have fun and good luck!</p>

<p>Phua, a Malaysian national, was apprehended along with four other men on charges of using electronic devices to manipulate casino games. The men had allegedly been using a camera lens and a computer to predict the outcome of cards at the Wynn and MGM resorts.</p>
<p>The FBI alleges that Phua and his associates were attempting to win back money that they had lost while gambling in the casinos.</p>
<p>Despite the high-profile arrest, business appears to be continuing as usual for Phua’s associates. One unnamed associate was seen entering the Bellagio casino on Wednesday, just one day after Phua’s arrest.</p>
<p>When asked by reporters if he was concerned about being caught, the associate replied “No, not at all.”</p>
<p>It is unclear whether or not law enforcement plans to pursue further arrests in connection with the casino cheat ring.</p>
<h1 id="Florida’s-Poker-Scene-Booming-Amidst-Cheating-Scandal"><a href="#Florida’s-Poker-Scene-Booming-Amidst-Cheating-Scandal" class="headerlink" title="Florida’s Poker Scene Booming Amidst Cheating Scandal"></a>Florida’s Poker Scene Booming Amidst Cheating Scandal</h1><p>A cheating scandal at the world series of poker in Las Vegas has rocked the poker community, but in Florida the scene is still booming.</p>
<p>Just a few miles from the beach in Hollywood, FL, cards are being dealt at all hours at one of the busiest poker rooms in the state. “There’s always a game going on here,” said regular player Jesse.</p>
<p>And it’s not just locals who are taking part. The poker room routinely attracts players from all over South Florida, as well as tourists who are looking for a different kind of gambling experience than what’s available at the casinos.</p>
<p>“This is an old school room,” said Jesse. “It’s not like those new fancy rooms where you’re playing against a machine. Here, it’s all about bluffing and reading other players.”</p>
<p>That kind of challenge is one reason why the cheating scandal at the world series of poker has had little impact on business in Florida. In fact, some players say they are actually enjoying the increased competition brought on by the scandal.</p>
<p>“ Players are getting more cautious now and that makes for better games,” said Jesse. “There’s been a lot of talk about what went on in Vegas, but it doesn’t seem to be affecting things down here.”</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Alleged-Cheat-Does-Not-Plan-to-Leave-Florida"><a href="#PokerStars-Alleged-Cheat-Does-Not-Plan-to-Leave-Florida" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Alleged Cheat Does Not Plan to Leave Florida"></a>PokerStars Alleged Cheat Does Not Plan to Leave Florida</h1><p>The alleged cheat at the center of the PokerStars cheating scandal says he has no plans to leave Florida.</p>
<h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The man, who is only known by his online alias “Dimitryi,” is said to have cheated his way to over $200,000 in winnings on the site. He was caught after players noticed impossible hand histories on the site and alerted PokerStars.</p>
<p> Dimitryi has denied any wrongdoing, but has been banned from playing on PokerStars since the allegations surfaced.</p>
<p>He recently gave an interview to a Russian-language poker news outlet in which he claimed that he “did not do anything wrong” and that he had no intention of leaving Florida.</p>
<p>Despite Dimitryi’s assertion of innocence, there is evidence that appears to back up the cheating allegations against him. In addition to the suspicious hand histories, Dimitryi was caught on camera celebrating a large winning hand in a way that appeared to be inconsistent with how a regular winner would behave.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Casino-Cheating-Ring-Uncovered"><a href="#Florida-Casino-Cheating-Ring-Uncovered" class="headerlink" title="Florida Casino Cheating Ring Uncovered"></a>Florida Casino Cheating Ring Uncovered</h1><p>A casino cheating ring that operated in several Florida casinos has been busted by the police. The six-person ring, which included a dealer and four players, is accused of cheating at blackjack and other table games between November and January.</p>
<p>The group allegedly used various methods to cheat, including card counting and marking cards. They are also accused of using electronics to help them win, including a device that could predict the outcome of dice rolls.</p>
<p>The suspects have all been charged with cheating, conspiracy to commit fraud, and possession of equipment for cheating. If found guilty, they could face up to 25 years in prison.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a casino cheating ring has been busted in Florida. In 2017, 11 people were arrested for cheating at blackjack and other games at a number of casinos around the state.</p>
<p>While it may seem like an easy way to make money, casino cheating can be risky business. Casino security is usually very tight, and if you are caught you can face criminal charges and lose your winnings. So if you’re thinking of trying your hand at casino cheating, be sure to weigh the risks before you take the plunge.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Poker-Players-warned-to-lookout-for-Cheats"><a href="#Florida-Poker-Players-warned-to-lookout-for-Cheats" class="headerlink" title="Florida Poker Players warned to lookout for Cheats"></a>Florida Poker Players warned to lookout for Cheats</h1><p>Online poker players in Florida have been warned to lookout for cheats and scammers. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) issued the warning after several complaints were filed by poker players who say they were scammed out of their money.</p>
<p>One player, who wished to remain anonymous, said that she was playing online poker when she was contacted by a player who offered to share information about upcoming hands in return for money. The woman agreed and sent the player $200. The next hand, the woman lost all her chips.</p>
<p>“I feel like an idiot, but I’m just thankful that I didn’t give him any more money,” she said.</p>
<p>Authorities are urging online poker players in Florida to be vigilant when playing online and to only deal with reputable sites.</p>

The November ballot measure authorized up to 24 casinos, including six in St. Louis County and four each in Kansas City and St. Joseph.</p>
<p>The potential for casino development has created a buzz among local officials who see the potential for new jobs and tax revenue. The Kansas City Star reported that developers are already proposing sites for casinos and that negotiations are underway for some of the licenses.</p>
<p>MoDOT urges caution while driving near work zones</p>
<p>The Missouri Department of Transportation is urging drivers to use caution while driving through work zones following an uptick in crashes. According to data from the department, there were 1,023 crashes in Missouri work zones during 2017, resulting in nine fatalities and 534 injuries.</p>
<p>“We want everyone traveling through our work zones to keep themselves and our workers safe,” said MoDOT Deputy Director Randy Luebkeman. “That means slowing down and paying attention – especially in inclement weather.”</p>
<p>Luebkeman noted that the number of crashes increased by about 10 percent from 2016 to 2017. In response, MoDOT is increasing its efforts to educate drivers about how to safely navigate work zones. These efforts include targeted advertising, social media outreach and updates on the department’s website.</p>

In recent years, other destinations, such as Atlantic City, New Jersey and Biloxi, Mississippi have offered more gambling options, but Vegas still reigns supreme. Could a small town in rural Kentucky make a run at becoming the next big casino destination?</p>
<h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Oo Ga Cha Ka (pronounced “oogah chah kah”) is a small town located in Harlan County, Kentucky. The town has seen a resurgence in recent years as it has become a popular destination for those looking for an escape from city life. The main attraction in Oo Ga Cha Ka is the Harlan Sands Casino Resort. The casino resort offers all of the typical casino games, such as blackjack, poker and slots, as well as several restaurants and a hotel.</p>
<h1 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The casino resort has been a big hit with locals and visitors alike. In fact, the casino has been so successful that its owners are looking to expand their operation. They have recently purchased land adjacent to the casino resort and are planning to build a new hotel and convention center. If everything goes according to plan, the new hotel will be open by the end of 2018.</p>
<h1 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The expansion of the Harlan Sands Casino Resort is great news for Oo Ga Cha Ka and Harlan County. The additional jobs and revenue that the casino will bring should help to boost the local economy. In addition, the new hotel will provide much-needed jobs for the area.</p>

<p>The popularity of casinos in Missouri is not just limited to tourists. Many local residents also enjoy gambling at the state’s casinos.

The basic rules are easy to learn, and even children can play the game with minimal instruction.</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt two cards face down. The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible by taking turns drawing cards from the deck and discarding one card at a time.

<ul>
<li>A player may only discard one card at a time.</li>
<li>A player cannot discard a card that would leave them with no more options (e.g., they cannot discard two Kings if they only have two cards left in their hand).</li>
<li>If a player draws a card that they cannot use, they must either put it back into the deck or place it in front of them (face up). This card becomes part of their hand.</li>
<li>In order to win, the final card discarded by the player must be placed into the deck (not among their other cards). </li>
</ul>

<p>The easiest way to score points in casino card game FC Schalke 04 is by capturing cards. When you capture a card, you either collect it or place it in front of you.

<p>You can also score points by taking tricks. A trick is comprised of four cards, one from each player. The player who plays the highest valued card collects the trick and scores one point. The player who plays the lowest valued card picks up the trick and scores negative one point. If two or more players play the same valued card, then no one scores a point for that trick and the cards are re-dealt.</p>
<p>There are also bonus points available in casino card game FC Schalke 04. For example, if you manage to capture all six black queens during a single round, then you score an extra twelve points. Likewise, if you can capture all four aces during a single round, then you score an extra four points.
