        <h1 id="Parkin’-Ain’t-Cheap-At-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert"><a href="#Parkin’-Ain’t-Cheap-At-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert" class="headerlink" title="Parkin’ Ain’t Cheap At Greektown Casino Flaubert!"></a>Parkin’ Ain’t Cheap At Greektown Casino Flaubert!</h1><p>If you’re looking for a place to park in downtown Detroit, be prepared to spend a pretty penny. According to my findings, the parking garage at Greektown Casino is by far the most expensive parking spot in the city.</p>
<p>For example, on a recent weekday afternoon I drove around and collected prices from various lots and garages in the vicinity of Greektown. The highest price I found was at the casino, where it costs $12 to park for four hours. Compare that to, say, Joe Louis Arena, where it costs just $6 to park for four hours.</p>
<p>In fact, if you’re only going to be in downtown Detroit for a few hours, it’s probably not worth it to park at Greektown Casino at all. You can find cheaper spots just a few blocks away.</p>
<p>So why does Greektown Casino charge so much for parking? My guess is because they can get away with it. There’s really no other option if you want to stay near downtown Detroit, and people are willing to pay the price because they don’t want to have to walk very far.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you have to accept high parking prices as part of life in Detroit. If you’re willing to venture out a bit, you can usually find a spot that’s more affordable. Just be prepared for a longer walk.</p>
<h1 id="Parking-Rates-Nearly-Double-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert"><a href="#Parking-Rates-Nearly-Double-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert" class="headerlink" title="Parking Rates Nearly Double at Greektown Casino Flaubert!"></a>Parking Rates Nearly Double at Greektown Casino Flaubert!</h1><p>The city’s casino operator, Greektown Casino Flaubert, has announced that it will be increasing its parking rates starting December 1st. Lot A will now cost $10 to park in, up from the current rate of $5, and Lot B will cost $15 to park in, up from the current rate of $8.</p>
<p>This move by the casino is likely an effort to help address the casino’s $3 million budget shortfall. In a statement released earlier this week, Greektown Casino Flaubert officials said that they are “working hard to manage our costs and improve our bottom line.”</p>
<p>The new parking rates are sure to anger many casino patrons, especially since the city’s other two casinos ( MotorCity Casino and MGM Grand Detroit ) have not raised their parking rates in recent memory.</p>

<p>Greektown Casino has announced that it will be raising its parking rates to $10 per day.</p>
<p>The new casino, MGM Detroit, is set to open in August and will offer 2,000 parking spaces.</p>
<p>Greektown Casino currently offers 2,500 parking spaces with a rate of $5 per day.</p>
<p>“Greektown Casino is committed to providing the best possible customer service and believe that this rate adjustment is necessary to meet the demands of our guests,” said Vice President and General Manager George Kiktesoglou in a statement. “MGM Detroit’s impending opening is another sign of Detroit’s resurgence and we are proud to be part of it.”</p>
<h1 id="Greektown-Casino-Flaubert-Introduces-Ridiculously-High-Parking-Fees"><a href="#Greektown-Casino-Flaubert-Introduces-Ridiculously-High-Parking-Fees" class="headerlink" title="Greektown Casino Flaubert Introduces Ridiculously High Parking Fees!"></a>Greektown Casino Flaubert Introduces Ridiculously High Parking Fees!</h1><p>In an unexpected turn of events, the casino known as Greektown has decided to start charging a fee for parking. This news comes as a surprise to many in the city, who are already struggling with the high cost of living in Detroit.</p>
<p>The new fees will be implemented at the beginning of next month and will cost drivers $10 to park their vehicles for up to 12 hours. The casino has justified the decision by citing the need to make improvements to its parking infrastructure.</p>
<p>Critics of the move say that it will only serve to push people away from Greektown and further damage Detroit’s economy. They argue that the city is already struggling with too many fees and taxes, and that this latest measure will only add to the burden on taxpayers.</p>
<p>Others have defended the decision, saying that it was needed in order to improve traffic flow and make it easier for people to get in and out of the casino. They also argue that $10 is a reasonable fee given the amount of time that it allows people to park for.</p>

<h1 id="Who-Can-Afford-to-Park-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert"><a href="#Who-Can-Afford-to-Park-at-Greektown-Casino-Flaubert" class="headerlink" title="Who Can Afford to Park at Greektown Casino Flaubert?"></a>Who Can Afford to Park at Greektown Casino Flaubert?</h1><p>The cost to park at the Greektown Casino Flaubert has been a hot topic of discussion in Detroit. As the casino celebrates its one-year anniversary, many are questioning how much it actually costs to park there.</p>
<p>According to the casino’s website, it costs $10 for up to 12 hours of parking, and $20 for up to 24 hours of parking. But as many Detroiters have discovered, that price is not always enforced. In fact, on a November visit by Motor City Muckraker, lots of cars were parked for free.</p>
<p>Greektown Casino spokesperson Lester Gilbert told Motor City Muckraker that “the $10 and $20 rates are only if you go over the time limit. If you come and park and leave within the time limit, there’s no charge.”</p>
<p>However, when Motor City Muckraker drove around the casino complex on a weekday morning, all of the signs at the entrances said “$10 for up to 12 hours” or “$20 for up to 24 hours.”</p>
<p>And despite what Gilbert told Motor City Muckraker, several people who had just left the casino said they were charged $10 after spending less than 12 hours there.</p>
<p>So who can afford to park at Greektown Casino Flaubert? It seems that those who can afford it are those who don’t mind spending an extra $10 or so after their visit. But for those who want to save money – or those who simply can’t afford it – finding a place to park can be a challenge.</p>
