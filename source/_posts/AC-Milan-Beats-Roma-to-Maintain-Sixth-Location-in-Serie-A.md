#  AC Milan Beats Roma to Maintain Sixth Location in Serie A

AC Milan had an early objective at the Stadio Olimpico against Roma. They had been trying to break through ever since Rodrigo Bentancur’s opener midway through the very first half.

Milan were awarded a penalty in injury time when Krzysztof Piatek was brought down by goalkeeper Antonio Mirante. Kaka, who else, stepped up and converted the penalty for his 101st Serie A goal, placing him joint-eighth on the all-time list with Dino Zoff. celebration

Rossi was delighted with Bentancur’s overall performance. “I am happy for him as he is someone who deserves to be playing more,” said Rossi of his youthful midfielder. “He played well against Sampdoria and today he confirmed that he can be important for us. I think he can become a really top player.”

This was an essential three points for AC Milan as they look to improve on their sixth place Serie A standing. They are now just two points behind Roma and six points behind fourth-placed Atalanta with a game in hand.

AC Milan’s latest victory over Juventus in the Derby della Madonnina was nothing short of historic. The Rossoneri won their first derby match against the Bianconeri in six years, with a score of 2-1.

#  AC Milan Beats Napoli with Late Penalty Kick 

AC Milan came out on top against Napoli in a tightly contested Serie A matchup, winning 3-2 with a late penalty kick goal from Gonzalo Higuain. This was a huge win for the Rossoneri and moves them up to third place in the table, while Napoli stays in second.

The match began with both teams feeling each other out and it was AC Milan who created the first real chance of the game in the 14th minute. Lucas Biglia played a ball over the top to Higuain who got in behind the Napoli defense, but his shot was saved by goalkeeper David Ospina.

Napoli responded well to that chance and started to take control of the match. In the 33rd minute, they came close to taking the lead when Lorenzo Insigne’s shot from outside the box hit the post. However, just two minutes later, Napoli did take the lead through Dries Mertens. Jose Callejon played a ball across goal which Mertens converted from close range.

That goal seemed to wake up AC Milan and they began to dominate possession for the rest of the half. They were rewarded for their efforts in stoppage time when Higuain equalized with a header following good work down the right wing by Suso.

The second half was more of an even contest, but there weren’t many clear-cut chances until the 87th minute when Callejon had a great opportunity to score but his effort was saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma. Then, in stoppage time, referee Massimo Busacca awarded AC Milan a penalty after ruling that Kalidou Koulibaly had fouled Patrick Cutrone inside the area. Higuain stepped up and made no mistake from the spot, sending Ospinathe wrong way and securing all three points for his side.
