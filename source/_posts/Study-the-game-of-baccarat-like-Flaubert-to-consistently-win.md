#  Study the game of baccarat like Flaubert to consistently win

There is an old adage in the world of gambling that goes, “Study the game like Flaubert to consistently win.” This implies that in order to have a successful gambling experience, you need to have an in-depth understanding of the game you are playing. So if you’re looking to win at baccarat, make sure you read on and learn everything there is to know about this interesting casino game.

baccarat is a card game that is thought to have originated in Italy in the 15th century. It is a relatively simple game to play, and is enjoyed by players all over the world. The aim of the game is to achieve a hand total that is as close as possible to nine. There are three possible outcomes in baccarat – Player (P), Banker (B), and Tie (T). The majority of baccarat games are played with six decks of cards, which are reshuffled after each hand.

The first thing you need to understand about playing baccarat is the different types of bets that are available. There are three main types of bet – player, banker, and tie. You can also bet on a ‘push’, which means the two hands are equal in value. Let’s take a look at each type of bet in more detail.

Player bets: A player bet is simply a wager on whether or not you think the player will win the hand. If the player wins, your bet will pay out at even money odds (1:1). If the player loses, you lose your bet amount.

Banker bets: A banker bet is similar to a player bet, but instead of betting on whether or not the player will win, you are betting on whether or not the banker will win. If the banker wins, your bet will pay out at even money odds (1:1). If the banker loses, you lose your bet amount.

Tie bets: A tie bet is a wager on whether or not you think the two hands will tie. If they do tie, your bet pays out at 8:1 odds. If they don’t tie, you lose your bet amount.

Now that we know about the different types of bets available, let’s take a look at how to calculate your hand total in baccarat. In this game, your hand total is calculated by adding together all card values except for tens and court cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings). So for example, if you were dealt an Ace and a three, your hand total would be four (Ace = 1 + 3 = 4). As mentioned earlier, the goal is to achieve a hand total as close as possible to nine. So in this particular example, four would be closest to nine without going over (4 + 5 = 9).

One other important thing to note about baccarat is that only the two highest cards from each hand are used when calculating your final hand total – so for example if you were dealt an Ace and two twos as your two starting cards, only Ace and two would be used when working out your final total (Ace = 1 + 2 = 3). This can be important to remember when trying to work out possible winning hands!

Now that we know all there is to know about baccarat basics let’s take a look at some strategy tips for how best to play this fascinating casino game…


When it comes to choosing between placing a player or banker bet , it’s important to remember that banker bets have slightly better odds than player bets . So if you’re unsure about which hand will win , it might be worth opting for a banker bet instead .




If both hands are tied , then eight times your original stake will be paid out . This makes tie bets one of the more lucrative options available when playing baccarat .





 When it comes time to decide whether or not to stand or hit , always err on the side of caution . Unless there’s only one card left in the deck and it’s advantageous for you , always opt notto hit . This increases your chances of winning overall .

#  Follow Flaubert's tips to win at baccarat every time

Forget what you think you know about baccarat.  It's not a game of chance; it's a game of skill.

If you want to win at baccarat, you need to follow the tips of the pros.  Flaubert knew what he was talking about when he said, "There is no chance and no luck in baccarat--it's all science."

Here are some of Flaubert's tips for winning at baccarat:

1. Don't bet on the first two cards.  There's too much chance involved in those bets.  Instead, wait until the third card is drawn to place your bet.

2. Bet on the banker whenever possible.  The banker has a slightly higher chance of winning than the player, so it's usually a safer bet.

3. Don't be afraid to bet big.  Baccarat is a high-stakes game, so it's important to make big bets if you want to win big.

4. Be patient and stay calm.  This is perhaps the most important tip of all--if you get rattled, you're likely to lose money.  Be strategic, stay calm, and wait for the right opportunity to make your move.

#  Use Flaubert's winning strategy for baccarat and rake in the profits

Gustave Flaubert was a French writer who is considered one of the most influential novelists of all time. What many people don't know about him is that he was also an avid gambler, and he reportedly had a winning strategy for playing baccarat. Here's how you can use his tactics to your advantage and rake in some profits.

First, you need to understand the basic rules of baccarat. In this game, there are two hands dealt - the player hand and the banker hand. The object of the game is to bet on which hand will have a higher total value. The player and banker hands both start with two cards, and the total value of these cards is calculated using a simple counting system:

Aces = 1
 Points 2 through 9 = face value 10 = 0 (zero)
 Jacks, Queens and Kings = 10 points each
 A hand with an ace as its highest card is called a "natural," and beats any other hand. If both hands have the same total, the result is a draw and nobody wins or loses money on that round.

The first step in using Flaubert's strategy is to decide whether to bet on the player or banker hand. In general, it's best to bet on the banker hand because it has a slight edge over the player hand. However, there are times when it makes sense to bet on the player instead - for example, if the player has a natural or if there's a large spread between the banker's hand and the player's hand (more on this later).

After you've decided which hand to bet on, you need to calculate your odds. This is actually quite simple - just divide your stake by the total number of possible outcomes. So if you're betting $10 on the banker hand and there are six potential outcomes (three possible wins for Banker, two possible losses for Banker and one possible draw), your odds would be $10 / 6 = $1.66.

Now that you know your odds, it's time to make your bet! In order to make things simple, let's say that you're only betting in even amounts - $2, $4, $6 etc. Here's what your bets would look like using Flaubert's strategy:

If you think that Banker has an edge:   Bet Odds Stake    $2 1/3 $6    $4 2/3 $8    $6 1 $10  

If you think that Player has an edge: Bet Odds Stake    $2 1/3 $6    $4 2/3 $8

#  Win at baccarat like a pro with Flaubert's winning tips

Flaubert, a French novelist and playwright, was a casino frequenting expert. With over three decades of experience playing at various casinos in Europe, he was thought to have mastered the game of baccarat. After much study and practice, he developed a system that would help him win more often than not. Lucky for us, he shared his tips with the world in an 1891 article he wrote for "La Revue Blanche".

When playing baccarat, Flaubert recommends betting on the Banker every time. The House edge is only around 1%, so this is a conservative bet that gives you a good chance of winning in the long run. If the Banker wins, double your bet on the next hand; if it loses, reduce your bet on the next hand to reflect your loss. This strategy allows you to make money even when you lose some individual hands.

Another tip from Flaubert is to always keep track of which cards have been played. By remembering what's been shown and what's still in the deck, you can make smarter choices about which bets to make. For instance, if there are few high cards left in the deck, it's safer to bet on the Player rather than the Banker.

Following these pointers from Flaubert should give you a better chance of winning at baccarat - just be sure to stick to them faithfully!

#  How to win at baccarat - get winning tips from Flaubert

Baccarat is one of the simplest casino games to play, and yet it can be extremely lucrative if you know how to play it well. In this article, we will teach you everything you need to know about baccarat so that you can start winning some serious money at the casino.

To start off with, let’s take a look at the basic rules of baccarat. In this game, there are two hands – the ‘Player’ hand and the ‘Banker’ hand. The aim of the game is to bet on which of these hands will have a higher value. The cards are worth their face value, with Aces being worth 1 point, 2s through 10s being worth 10 points each, and Jacks, Queens and Kings being worth 0 points each. A hand consists of two or three cards.

The first thing you need to do when playing baccarat is decide whether to bet on the Player hand or the Banker hand. You can also choose to bet on a tie (which pays out at 8:1), but in general it is advisable not to bet on ties as they occur relatively infrequently. Once you have placed your bet, the dealer will deal two cards to each hand – one face up and one face down. The player then has two choices: either stand (ie keep the current total) or draw another card (in which case the new total is calculated). If both hands have the same value (a ‘push’), then no money changes hands and the player gets their original stake back.

The highest value hand in baccarat is 9 (earned by getting a 3 and 6), while the lowest value hand is 0 (earned by getting two 2s). As such, if you have a total of 7 or 8 then it is generally advisable to stand, as drawing another card would most likely result in a bust (ie a total of more than 10). If your hand has a value of 5 or 6 then you should also consider standing unless the Banker has a very low total (e.g. 4 or 5), as drawing another card could see you go over 10 and lose automatically.

Now that you understand how to play baccarat, let’s take a look at some tips for how to win at this game. Firstly, it is important to remember that baccarat is all about probabilities – there is no skill involved in this game, so all you can do is make educated guesses about what might happen next. With that in mind, here are some tips for increasing your chances of winning:

- Try to avoid betting on ties – these occur relatively infrequently and so your chances of winning are relatively low

- Bet on the Banker whenever possible – since the Banker has an edge over the Player hand, your chances of winning are slightly higher when betting on this option

- Remember that 3 and 6 are the highest value cards in baccarat – if you have any combination of these cards then you should consider standing

- Stay disciplined – make sure that you only bet what you can afford to lose, and never chase your losses
