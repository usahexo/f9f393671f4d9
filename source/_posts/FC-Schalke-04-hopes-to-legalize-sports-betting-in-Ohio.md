#  FC Schalke 04 hopes to legalize sports betting in Ohio

FC Schalke 04, a professional football club in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, is hoping to legalize sports betting in the state of Ohio. The hope is that this will help bolster the local economy and create new jobs.

In terms of its efforts to legalize sports betting in Ohio, FC Schalke 04 has partnered with SBTech, a global provider of online gaming and betting technology. SBTech will help FC Schalke 04 develop an online sportsbook for the state of Ohio.

“The partnership between FC Schalke 04 and SBTech is an important one for football clubs around the world who wish to enter the sports betting market,” commented Jeffrey Weinzweig, CEO of SBTech.

FC Schalke 04’s ultimate goal is to make Ohio a hub for legalized sports betting in the United States. This would allow the club to generate new revenue streams from sports betting while also creating jobs in the process.

In addition to FC Schalke 04, other major European football clubs such as Manchester City and AS Roma are also exploring the possibility of legalizing sports betting in their home countries.

FC Schalke 04, a professional German association football club based in the city of Gelsenkirchen, is looking to increase profits by getting into the legalized sports betting market in Ohio.

Schalke 04 was founded in 1904 and currently fields teams in both the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, the top two leagues in Germany. The club has won seven Bundesliga titles and five DFB-Pokal trophies, as well as one UEFA Champions League title.

In order to capitalize on this new opportunity, Schalke 04 has announced that it has partnered with SBTech, a global provider of sports betting and gaming solutions.

This partnership underlines our position as the world’s leading supplier of turnkey sports betting solutions and we look forward to helping Schalke 04 achieve success in the Ohio market.”



With the Supreme Court's recent ruling striking down PASPA, opening up the US market for legalized sports betting, it's no surprise that professional sports teams are lining up to get into the game. And one of the first out of the gate is German football club FC Schalke 04, which has announced a partnership with SBTech, a global provider of sports betting and gaming solutions.

Under the terms of the deal, SBTech will provide Schalke 04 with a comprehensive sports betting platform that will give fans access to online and offline betting options on all major sporting events around the world. This is a big win for SBTech, which is looking to establish itself as the world's leading supplier of turnkey sports betting solutions.

#  FC Schalke 04 eyes new market with legalized sports betting in Ohio

FC Schalke 04, a professional association football club in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, is looking to expand its market by entering the legalized sports betting market in Ohio. Tom Wright, President and CEO of FC Schalke 04 said in an interview with SBD Global that the club is looking to capitalize on the legalization of sports betting in Ohio and expects to earn millions of dollars in revenue from it each year.

“It’s something we’re keen to do as soon as it’s possible. We think there’s a lot of potential in the market. It will be one of our main focuses going forward,” Wright said.

Ohio legalized sports betting in November 2018 through a constitutional amendment that allows casinos in the state to offer legal sports betting. The amendment was approved by 63% of voters. Through its partnership with SBTech, FC Schalke 04 will have access to a comprehensive sports betting solution that will allow it to offer a wide range of bet types on both domestic and international sporting events.

"The move into regulated US sports betting is a pivotal moment for FC Schalke 04 and our fans around the world," said Wright. "Partnering with SBTech gives us access to the most sophisticatedsports betting technology available, as well as an understanding of this rapidly growing market that is second to none."

FC Schalke 04 joins other European football clubs such as AS Roma, Liverpool FC, and Juventus Turin that have also entered into partnerships with SBTech to offer sports betting services to their fans.

#  FC Schalke 04 hoping to cash in on legalized sports betting in Ohio

FC Schalke 04, a German football club, is looking to cash in on legalized sports betting in the US state of Ohio. The club has entered into a partnership with SBTech, a gaming technology provider, to help launch an online sportsbook in the state.

“This is an exciting and ground-breaking venture for Schalke 04, and we are looking forward to working with SBTech to bring our unique offering to Ohio players,” said Alexander Jobst, CEO of FC Schalke 04.

SBTech is also partnering with Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park, which will be the first casino in the state to offer legalized sports betting.

Ohio legalized sports betting in May 2019, following the repeal of the federal ban on the activity known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).

Since then, a number of states have followed suit, with New Jersey taking the lead. That state’s casino industry has reaped huge rewards from sports betting, generating over $1 billion in handle during its first full year of operation.

#  Ohioans still unable to bet on their favorite team as sports betting remains illegal

Despite a recent ruling by the Supreme Court overturning a law banning sports betting, Ohioans are still unable to place bets on their favorite teams. This is because the state legislature has failed to pass a bill which would authorize sports betting in the state.

Supporters of legalizing sports betting say that it could generate significant revenue for the state, as well as create jobs. They also argue that it would be a boon for tourism, as people from other states would come to Ohio to place bets on sports games.

Critics of legalizing sports betting say that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and criminal activity. They also argue that the state should not be in the business of gambling, and that the money generated by sports betting could be better used for other purposes.

So far, the state legislature has been unable to agree on whether or not to legalize sports betting. This means that Ohioans will continue to be unable to bet on their favorite teams, while other states such as Nevada and Delaware are reaping the benefits of legalized sports betting.
