The November ballot measure authorized up to 24 casinos, including six in St. Louis County and four each in Kansas City and St. Joseph.</p>
<p>The potential for casino development has created a buzz among local officials who see the potential for new jobs and tax revenue. The Kansas City Star reported that developers are already proposing sites for casinos and that negotiations are underway for some of the licenses.</p>
<p>MoDOT urges caution while driving near work zones</p>
<p>The Missouri Department of Transportation is urging drivers to use caution while driving through work zones following an uptick in crashes. According to data from the department, there were 1,023 crashes in Missouri work zones during 2017, resulting in nine fatalities and 534 injuries.</p>
<p>“We want everyone traveling through our work zones to keep themselves and our workers safe,” said MoDOT Deputy Director Randy Luebkeman. “That means slowing down and paying attention – especially in inclement weather.”</p>
<p>Luebkeman noted that the number of crashes increased by about 10 percent from 2016 to 2017. In response, MoDOT is increasing its efforts to educate drivers about how to safely navigate work zones. These efforts include targeted advertising, social media outreach and updates on the department’s website.</p>

In recent years, other destinations, such as Atlantic City, New Jersey and Biloxi, Mississippi have offered more gambling options, but Vegas still reigns supreme. Could a small town in rural Kentucky make a run at becoming the next big casino destination?</p>
<h1 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Oo Ga Cha Ka (pronounced “oogah chah kah”) is a small town located in Harlan County, Kentucky. The town has seen a resurgence in recent years as it has become a popular destination for those looking for an escape from city life. The main attraction in Oo Ga Cha Ka is the Harlan Sands Casino Resort. The casino resort offers all of the typical casino games, such as blackjack, poker and slots, as well as several restaurants and a hotel.</p>
<h1 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The casino resort has been a big hit with locals and visitors alike. In fact, the casino has been so successful that its owners are looking to expand their operation. They have recently purchased land adjacent to the casino resort and are planning to build a new hotel and convention center. If everything goes according to plan, the new hotel will be open by the end of 2018.</p>
<h1 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>The expansion of the Harlan Sands Casino Resort is great news for Oo Ga Cha Ka and Harlan County. The additional jobs and revenue that the casino will bring should help to boost the local economy. In addition, the new hotel will provide much-needed jobs for the area.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-industry-on-the-rise-in-Missouri"><a href="#Casino-industry-on-the-rise-in-Missouri" class="headerlink" title="Casino industry on the rise in Missouri!"></a>Casino industry on the rise in Missouri!</h1><p>The casino industry is on the rise in Missouri as more and more people are visiting casinos. According to a recent study, the casino industry has been growing at a rate of 6.4% each year in Missouri. This is largely due to the fact that casinos are becoming increasingly popular, with more people looking for new and exciting ways to gamble.</p>
<p>There are a number of different casinos in Missouri, including Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles, Isle of Capri Casino Boonville, and Lady Luck® Nemacolin Woodlands Resort. These casinos offer a variety of gambling options, including slot machines, table games, and poker tournaments. They also offer a range of other amenities, such as restaurants, hotels, and spas.</p>
<p>The popularity of casinos in Missouri is not just limited to tourists. Many local residents also enjoy gambling at the state’s casinos. In fact, according to the study mentioned earlier, local residents account for over 60% of casino revenue in Missouri. This is likely due to the fact that many local residents view casinos as a fun way to spend their free time.</p>
<p>Casinos have also created jobs in Missouri. The study found that the casino industry employs over 9,000 people in the state. This includes jobs in both the casino itself and in associated businesses, such as restaurants and hotels. These jobs are important for the local economy and help to support thousands of families.</p>
<p>The rise of the casino industry in Missouri is good news for both tourists and locals alike. The casinos offer a fun and exciting way to spend time while also providing jobs and economic benefits for the state. If you’re looking for a new destination to visit or something fun to do on a weekend night, be sure to check out one of Missouri’s casinos!</p>
<h1 id="Are-you-ready-to-gamble-in-Missouri"><a href="#Are-you-ready-to-gamble-in-Missouri" class="headerlink" title="Are you ready to gamble in Missouri?"></a>Are you ready to gamble in Missouri?</h1><p>There are many different types of gambling that people can participate in throughout Missouri. Whether someone is looking to try their luck at a casino, play the lottery, or bet on a horse race, there are plenty of options available throughout the state.</p>
<p>One popular gambling destination in Missouri is the Ameristar Casino in St. Charles. This casino offers a variety of gaming options, including slot machines, blackjack tables, and poker rooms. There is also a hotel on site for guests who want to stay overnight.</p>
<p>Another option for gambling in Missouri is betting on horse races. The state has several race tracks where people can place bets on the outcomes of various races. Some of these tracks include Remington Park in Oklahoma City and Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas.</p>
<p>Finally, Missouri residents can also purchase lottery tickets from various retailers throughout the state. The Missouri Lottery offers a variety of games, including Powerball, Mega Millions, and Show Me Cash.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-casinos-breaking-records"><a href="#Missouri-casinos-breaking-records" class="headerlink" title="Missouri casinos breaking records!"></a>Missouri casinos breaking records!</h1><p>Casinos in Missouri continue to break their own revenue records, according to the latest figures released by the Missouri Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2018, casinos in Missouri generated a combined $1.35 billion in revenue – a new record and an increase of 5.5% from the previous fiscal year. MGM Springfield was the star performer, generating over $265 million in revenue – up 24% from FY2017.</p>
<p>This news is great for the state of Missouri, which derives significant tax revenue from casino gambling. In FY2018, casino taxes generated over $290 million for state and local governments – an increase of 8% over the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>The continued success of casinos in Missouri is also good news for the casino industry as a whole. With revenues continuing to grow, it appears that casinos are still attracting plenty of customers despite increasing competition from online gambling sites.</p>
