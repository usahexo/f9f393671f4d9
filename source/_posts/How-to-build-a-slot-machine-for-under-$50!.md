#  How to build a slot machine for under $50!

In this article we are going to build a slot machine for under $50. 

The first step is to gather the materials needed for the project. The list of materials needed are as follows:

-1 x Arduino Uno Board ($25)
-1 x Stepper Motor Driver Board (Pololu A4988) ($12)
-1 x Stepper Motor (NEMA 17) ($11)
-1 x 10k Ohm Potentiometer (variable resistor) ($2)
-3 x Tactile Switches (push buttons) ($3)
- assorted hookup wire and breadboard wire ($5?)

Total Cost: ~$54 not including shipping costs.

 Now that the materials have been acquired, it's time to start assembling the project. The first step is to attach the stepper motor driver board to the Arduino Uno.  There are four pins on each board that need to be matched up: Vin, GND, Step, and Dir. Match up each pin on the driver board with its corresponding pin on the Arduino Uno using some jumper wires. NOTE: The red and black wires on the stepper motor should be attached to pins 2 and 3 on the driver board, respectively.

 The next step is to connect the potentiometer to the Arduino Uno. There are three legs on a potentiometer: one at each end and one in the middle. Strip off a couple inches of insulation from each wire and twist them together so they form a small loop. Do this for all three wires then solder them together. Next, cut a small piece of shrink tubing and place it over the soldered connection then use a heat gun or lighter to shrink it in place. Finally, solder one end of each wire to pins A0, A1, and A2 on the Arduino Uno as shown in the diagram below:

 Now it's time to attach the tactile switches to the project. Each switch has two leads: one for ground and one for signal. Solder one end of each wire to ground (GND) and signal (V+) on any of the digital pins on the Arduino Uno as shown in the diagram below:

The last step is to put everything together in a nice little package! For this project I chose to use a plastic enclosure from Radio Shack (part number 270-1807). It's an 8x5x2 inch box that costs $3.99 at Radio Shack but can be found cheaper online if you search around a bit . If you choose not use an enclosure, just make sure everything is securely fastened down so it doesn't move around while in use.. Drill two holes in opposite corners of the enclosure for mounting the stepper motor then cut out a hole in one side of th box for access to tthe potentiometer knob . Mount everything inside th box using screws or hot glue then zip tie all of th wires together so they don't get tangled up . Here's what mine ended up looking like when finished:



#  How to build a slot machine in less than an hour!

Slot machines are a lot of fun and can be a profitable addition to any casino. In this article, we're going to show you how to build your own slot machine in less than an hour!

The first step is to gather the materials you'll need. For this project, you'll need:

* A breadboard

* Jumper wires

* A stepper motor

* A power supply

* A microcontroller board such as an Arduino Uno

* Three LEDs

* Three resistors (220 ohms)

* One capacitor (0.1 ÂµF)

* One diode (1N4001)

* One slot machine wheel (you can find these online or at a hobby store)




  The Arduino microcontroller is at the heart of the project and controls all the action. The code for the project can be found on our website [1]. Connect the Stepper motor, power supply, and LEDs to the Arduino as shown in the diagram below: 



  Once everything is connected, it's time to write some code! The code is very simple. We start by defining the pins that we're using: 

pinMode(9, OUTPUT); //Stepper Motor Pin 1 - Red Wire pinMode(10, OUTPUT); //Stepper Motor Pin 2 - Yellow Wire pinMode(11, OUTPUT); //Stepper Motor Pin 3 - Green Wire  

Next, we create a function called "stepMotor" which will take two parameters - amount_of_steps and delay_in_milliseconds . This function will move the stepper motor by a given number of steps and then wait for a given number of milliseconds before moving again. We also create a variable called currentStep which keeps track of our current position in the sequence:  

void stepMotor(int amount_of_steps, int delay_in_milliseconds){ int currentStep = 0; for (int i = 0; i < amount_of_steps; i++){ digitalWrite(9, HIGH); //Turn ON Red Wire delayMicroseconds(delay_in_milliseconds); //Wait for Delay digitalWrite(10, LOW); //Turn OFF Yellow Wire delayMicroseconds(delay_in_milliseconds); //Wait for Delay digitalWrite(11, HIGH); //Turn ON Green Wire delayMicroseconds(delay_in_milliseconds); //Wait for Delay } currentStep++; }  

Finally, we create a loop which calls our "stepMotor" function repeatedly. We also check to see if currentStep is equal to 5 (indicating that we've reached the end of the sequence). If so, we reset currentStep back to 0 : 

void loop(){ stepMotor(5, 2000); if (currentStep==5){ currentStep = 0; } }

#  How to make a slot machine with common materials!

Slot machines are a lot of fun and can be made with common materials. You will need a cardboard box, paper, tape, scissors, and a coin.

 Cut four equal length strips from the cardboard box using the scissors. These will become the sides of the slot machine.

On three of the strips, cut small rectangles about 1 inch wide and 3 inches long. These will become the "windows" on the slot machine.

Take one of the remaining strips and cut it into two pieces, each about 6 inches long. These will become the "arms" of the slot machine.

Tape one end of each arm strip to either end of one of the window strips. Tape the other end of each arm strip to either end of one of the side strips so that there is an arm on each side of each window strip. The slot machine should now look like a rectangular prism with four arms sticking out at right angles on each face.

Turn your slot machine over so that the arms are pointing down and tape a coin onto the top center of the machine so that it balances there. Your slot machine is now ready to play!

#  How to build your own slot machine at home! 

Building your own slot machine at home is a fun and easy project that can be completed in a weekend. You will need some basic tools and materials, including a power drill, jigsaw, clamps, wood glue, and a saw blade.

The first step is to cut the pieces for the frame of the slot machine. Use a power drill to make pilot holes for the screws, then use a jigsaw to cut out the shapes. Clamp the pieces together and use wood glue to attach them. Let the glue dry overnight.

Next, use a saw blade to cut out the shapes for the front and back panels of the slot machine. Drill pilot holes and use wood screws to attach them to the frame.

The next step is to make the handle. Drill two pilot holes in each end and use wood screws to attach them to the front panel.

The last step is to make the payout tray. Drill pilot holes in each corner and use wood screws to attach it to the back panel.

Your slot machine is now complete! Have fun playing with it!

#  How to create a Slot Machine using household items!

In this article we will be creating a Slot Machine using everyday household items that you can find in your home. This project is a fun and easy way to create your own Slot Machine, and does not require any advanced skills or tools. Lets get started!

The first step is to gather the supplies you will need for this project. You will need an empty cardboard box, masking tape, scissors, a pen or pencil, a ruler, and some small coins or tokens.

Next, you will need to cut the cardboard box into four equal-sized pieces using the scissors. These four pieces will be the sides of your Slot Machine.

Now it's time to start assembling the Slot Machine. Take two of the cardboard pieces and tape them together so that they form a square shape. Make sure that the two pieces are aligned properly and that there are no gaps between them. Once they are taped together, repeat this process with the other two pieces to create the second side of the Slot Machine.

Now that you have created the basic structure of the Slot Machine, it's time to add the details. Cut four small rectangular shapes out of one of the sides of the machine (see diagram). These will be the "wheels" on your Slot Machine. Tape them in place on each side of the machine as shown in the diagram.

Finally, use masking tape to create a "handle" on top of your Slot Machine. This will be used to spin the wheels.

Your Slot Machine is now complete! To use it, simply place some small coins or tokens in between the two sides of the machine and then spin the wheel with the handle. The slots on each side of the machine will rotate and eventually stop on one of three positions: WINNINGS, LOSE PLAYERS COINS, or FREE PLAYS. If you stop on WINNINGS then you win whatever coins are bet; if you stop on LOSE PLAYERS COINS then you lose all your coins; if you stop on FREE PLAYS then you get another chance to spin without losing any coins. Have Fun!
