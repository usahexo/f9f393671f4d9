        <h1 id="AC-Milan-Beats-Roma-to-Maintain-Sixth-Location-in-Serie-A"><a href="#AC-Milan-Beats-Roma-to-Maintain-Sixth-Location-in-Serie-A" class="headerlink" title="AC Milan Beats Roma to Maintain Sixth Location in Serie A"></a>AC Milan Beats Roma to Maintain Sixth Location in Serie A</h1><p>AC Milan had an early objective at the Stadio Olimpico against Roma. They had been trying to break through ever since Rodrigo Bentancur’s opener midway through the very first half. The Uruguayan playmaker has not had much playing time this season, but he may have made Giuseppe Rossi’s decision to loan him out from Juventus appear like a sensible one.</p>
<p>Milan were awarded a penalty in injury time when Krzysztof Piatek was brought down by goalkeeper Antonio Mirante. Kaka, who else, stepped up and converted the penalty for his 101st Serie A goal, placing him joint-eighth on the all-time list with Dino Zoff. celebration</p>
<p>Rossi was delighted with Bentancur’s overall performance. “I am happy for him as he is someone who deserves to be playing more,” said Rossi of his youthful midfielder. “He played well against Sampdoria and today he confirmed that he can be important for us. I think he can become a really top player.”</p>
<p>This was an essential three points for AC Milan as they look to improve on their sixth place Serie A standing. They are now just two points behind Roma and six points behind fourth-placed Atalanta with a game in hand.</p>
<h1 id="AC-Milan-Beats-Juventus-in-Historic-Derby-della-Madonnina"><a href="#AC-Milan-Beats-Juventus-in-Historic-Derby-della-Madonnina" class="headerlink" title="AC Milan Beats Juventus in Historic Derby della Madonnina"></a>AC Milan Beats Juventus in Historic Derby della Madonnina</h1><p>AC Milan’s latest victory over Juventus in the Derby della Madonnina was nothing short of historic. The Rossoneri won their first derby match against the Bianconeri in six years, with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>This season has been a tough one for AC Milan, as they are currently battling to avoid relegation from Serie A. However, this win against Juventus could be just what they need to keep their heads up and make a comeback.</p>
<p>Juventus took an early lead in the 14th minute when Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first goal against AC Milan. However, Milan captain Alessio Romagnoli equalized just two minutes later, and former Juventus striker Gonzalo Higuain gave them the lead in the second half.</p>
<p>This win is a huge morale boost for AC Milan and their fans. It also helps to consolidate their sixth place in the Serie A standings. With only six games left in the season, every win is crucial for AC Milan if they want to secure their spot in next year’s Champions League.</p>
<h1 id="AC-Milan-Beats-Napoli-with-Late-Penalty-Kick"><a href="#AC-Milan-Beats-Napoli-with-Late-Penalty-Kick" class="headerlink" title="AC Milan Beats Napoli with Late Penalty Kick"></a>AC Milan Beats Napoli with Late Penalty Kick</h1><p>AC Milan came out on top against Napoli in a tightly contested Serie A matchup, winning 3-2 with a late penalty kick goal from Gonzalo Higuain. This was a huge win for the Rossoneri and moves them up to third place in the table, while Napoli stays in second.</p>
<p>The match began with both teams feeling each other out and it was AC Milan who created the first real chance of the game in the 14th minute. Lucas Biglia played a ball over the top to Higuain who got in behind the Napoli defense, but his shot was saved by goalkeeper David Ospina.</p>
<p>Napoli responded well to that chance and started to take control of the match. In the 33rd minute, they came close to taking the lead when Lorenzo Insigne’s shot from outside the box hit the post. However, just two minutes later, Napoli did take the lead through Dries Mertens. Jose Callejon played a ball across goal which Mertens converted from close range.</p>
<p>That goal seemed to wake up AC Milan and they began to dominate possession for the rest of the half. They were rewarded for their efforts in stoppage time when Higuain equalized with a header following good work down the right wing by Suso.</p>
<p>The second half was more of an even contest, but there weren’t many clear-cut chances until the 87th minute when Callejon had a great opportunity to score but his effort was saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma. Then, in stoppage time, referee Massimo Busacca awarded AC Milan a penalty after ruling that Kalidou Koulibaly had fouled Patrick Cutrone inside the area. Higuain stepped up and made no mistake from the spot, sending Ospinathe wrong way and securing all three points for his side.</p>
<h1 id="Gonzalo-Higuain-Scores-Twice-as-AC-Milan-Beats-Empoli-5-1"><a href="#Gonzalo-Higuain-Scores-Twice-as-AC-Milan-Beats-Empoli-5-1" class="headerlink" title="Gonzalo Higuain Scores Twice as AC Milan Beats Empoli 5-1"></a>Gonzalo Higuain Scores Twice as AC Milan Beats Empoli 5-1</h1><p>A brace from Gonzalo Higuain helped AC Milan to a 5-1 victory over Empoli in Serie A on Saturday.</p>
<p>Higuain, who played the last half hour of Wednesday’s 0-0 draw with Inter Milan, put Milan ahead in the 12th minute before doubling their lead before halftime.</p>
<p>Patrick Cutrone and Franck Kessie scored in the second half to seal the win, with Riccardo Saponara replying for Empoli.</p>
<p>The result leaves Milan sixth in Serie A, four points behind fourth-placed Lazio who have a game in hand.</p>
<p>Empoli are 15th, two points above the relegation zone.</p>
<h1 id="AC-Milan-Pulls-off-Shock-Victory-Against-Barcelona"><a href="#AC-Milan-Pulls-off-Shock-Victory-Against-Barcelona" class="headerlink" title="AC Milan Pulls off Shock Victory Against Barcelona"></a>AC Milan Pulls off Shock Victory Against Barcelona</h1><p>AC Milan pulled off one of the shocks of the season by beating Barcelona 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie at San Siro.</p>
<p> Goals from Patrick Cutrone and Franck Kessie either side of halftime gave Milan a surprise lead to take back to Camp Nou for the return leg in three weeks’ time.</p>
<p>Barcelona had 68 percent possession and completed 902 passes but could not find a way past Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who made several key saves.</p>
<p>Coach Gennaro Gattuso said: “It was an extraordinary evening. We played with all our heart and soul and I am happy with the players’ performance.</p>
<p>“I told them before the match that we were going to cause them problems and they would not have it easy. They are Messi, Suarez and Iniesta but we are not cannon fodder.”</p>
<p>Milan captain Leonardo Bonucci added: “We played a great game against a great team. We knew they would have more possession than us, but we hit them on the counterattack.”</p>
