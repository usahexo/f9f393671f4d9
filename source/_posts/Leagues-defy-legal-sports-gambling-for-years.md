#  Leagues defy legal sports gambling for years

The National Football League (NFL) was founded in 1920 as a nonprofit corporation. At the time, the NFL and its teams were against any form of legal sports gambling. The stated reason was to protect the integrity of the game.

Fast-forward nearly 100 years, and the NFL is now one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, with annual revenues of over $14 billion. And while the NFL still prohibits its players from betting on games, it has no problem taking billions of dollars in bets on its own games.

In fact, for years the NFL has been actively promoting and profiting from illegal sports gambling. This hypocritical stance has led to numerous lawsuits by disgruntled gamblers who claim they were cheated out of their money by rigged games.

One such case is currently before the Supreme Court. In 2014, New Jersey passed a law legalizing sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. The four major professional sports leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB) and the NCAA sued to block the law, claiming it violated their federal antitrust exemption.

In May 2018, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. A ruling is expected by June 2019. If New Jersey prevails, it could open up legalized sports betting nationwide, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue for both leagues and states.

So why did the NFL change its stance on legality? There are a few possible explanations:

1) The landscape has changed since 1920. With millions of Americans now betting on games illegally, it's become increasingly difficult to control what happens inside casinos and racetracks. Legalizing sports betting would give the NFL more oversight and allow it to profit from betting directly.

2) The league has faced increasing pressure from lawmakers to legalize sports betting in order to help offset declining viewership numbers. In 2017, ESPN reported that NFL viewership had fallen by 9% from the previous year. This decline is largely attributed to younger viewers dropping cable TV altogether in favor of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.

3) The NFL is simply catching up with other leagues around the world that have long embraced legal gambling. In fact, some European soccer leagues have been directly involved in setting up their own legal bookmaking operations.

#  Disobedience led to costly settlements

Residents of the town of Flint, Michigan, were outraged in April of 2014 when they learned their water supply had been contaminated with lead. The water had been deemed safe to drink by state and federal officials, but the residents had a different opinion.

They knew that their water was brown and coming out of the tap with a metallic taste. They knew something was wrong, but they were ignored by those in charge.

It would take nearly two years and a switched water source for the citizens of Flint to finally get clean drinking water. In that time, their health deteriorated, as lead is known to do. Babies were born with lead poisoning, people suffered from Legionnaires' disease and the general public was left angry and distrustful of those in power.

This story is not unique to Flint. Throughout history, people have spoken out against those in power and demanded change – often at great personal cost. Here are five examples of disobedience that led to costly settlements:

1) The Freedom Riders: In 1961, a group of black and white civil rights activists rode buses through the segregated South to challenge the Jim Crow laws that kept African Americans from using certain public facilities. The riders were met with violence and brutality at every stop, but they continued their journey until they reached Jackson, Mississippi – the most segregated city in America. The Freedom Riders' efforts helped to pave the way for the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

2) The Tiananmen Square Protests: In 1989, students and workers in Beijing gathered in Tiananmen Square to demand democratic reforms from the Chinese government. The protests escalated quickly, and on June 4th troops were sent in to violently suppress the demonstrators. Thousands were killed or injured in what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre. The Chinese government has never acknowledged responsibility for the killings and still refuses to release information about what happened there.

3) The Boston Tea Party: In 1773, colonists in Boston staged a protest against British taxes on tea. Dressed as Native Americans, they boarded ships belonging to the East India Company and dumped 342 chests of tea overboard into Boston Harbor. This event marked the beginning of the American Revolution and led to years of bloodshed between the British colonists and American revolutionaries.

4) Gandhi's Salt March: In 1930, Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi began a campaign of peaceful resistance against British rule in India. One of his most famous protests was called the Salt March – a march from Ahmedabad to Dandi Beach where Gandhi planned to collect salt without paying taxes to the British Crown. The march drew attention to Gandhi's cause and inspired others around India to stand up against British colonialism.

5) Rosa Parks' Bus Protest: On December 1st, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama – sparking a boycott of Montgomery's buses that lasted more than a year. The boycott was successful in bringing attention to racial segregation laws in America and helping begin the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s.

#  Leagues could have benefitted from legal gambling

The recent decision by the Supreme Court of the United States to legalize sports gambling could have a significant impact on professional and amateur sports leagues. The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which was passed in 1992, barred states from authorizing sports gambling. This effectively prevented any legalized form of gambling on sporting events.

Now that the law has been overturned, individual states are free to allow gambling on sporting events. While this could be a windfall for casinos and other gaming establishments, it could also provide a much-needed boost to professional and amateur sports leagues.

There are a few potential benefits that leagues could see from legalized gambling. First, it could provide a new revenue stream for leagues. Gambling is an important source of revenue for many leagues, and it is likely that this will only increase with the legalization of sports betting.

Leagues could also see an increase in viewership and attendance as a result of legalized gambling. Fans are already interested in betting on games, so offering legal options is likely to only further engage them. In fact, there is some evidence that suggests that fans are more likely to watch or attend games when there is money on the line.

Finally, legalizing gambling could help to reduce corruption in sports. There have been numerous cases of corruption in sports over the years, many of which have been linked to illegal gambling activities. Legalizing gambling would give leagues more tools to combat corruption and make sure that the results of sporting events are determined by athletic ability rather than illicit activities.

While there are certainly some potential benefits to legalized gambling, there are also some risks that leagues need to consider. The first risk is that gambling could lead to an increase in crime. There have been cases where gamblers have resorted to criminal activity in order to payoff their debts or cover their losses.

Another risk is that legalized gambling could lead to addiction problems for fans. It is possible that some fans will become addicted to gambling and will spend large amounts of time and money on wagering on sporting events. This could lead to financial problems for those individuals as well as strains on their personal relationships.

Leagues need to carefully weigh the pros and cons of legalized gambling before deciding whether or not they want to pursue it. However, given the potential benefits, it seems likely that many leagues will decide to embrace this new opportunity.

#  Some officials profited from offshore gambling sites

The leak of the so-called Panama Papers has implicated a number of world leaders, celebrities, and business moguls in offshore tax havens. But the revelations are also shedding light on how some government officials allegedly used their knowledge of offshore gambling sites to profit from them.

In particular, more than two dozen government employees and elected officials in the United States were found to have connections to gambling sites that operated illegally in the country. Many of these officials had involvement in creating or regulating those sites, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

For example, one former congressman allegedly received payments from an offshore site in exchange for helping it establish itself in the U.S. market. A state legislator is also accused of accepting money from an illegal gambling operation and using his political influence to keep it running.

These revelations come as no surprise to experts who have long argued that the American government has failed to adequately address illegal gambling. In fact, some lawmakers have been accused of exploiting the lack of regulation in this industry for their own personal gain.

Clearly, this scandal highlights the need for stronger regulations on offshore gambling operations. It is essential that we hold our elected officials accountable and make sure they are not benefiting from illegal activities.

#  Gambling addiction a problem in sports

Gambling is often considered a problem in society, but what about when it becomes an addiction in sports? Athletes are often under intense pressure to win, and this can lead to gambling as a way to try and increase their chances of success. Unfortunately, this can be a dangerous road to go down, as addiction can quickly take over.

There have been many cases of athletes becoming addicted to gambling, and the consequences have often been disastrous. In one famous example, a basketball player for the Utah Jazz lost over $10 million in a single year due to his gambling addiction. This led to his divorce and significant financial problems.

There have also been cases of professional athletes going on gambling binges that have led to them losing huge sums of money in a very short period of time. One notorious example is NBA player Gilbert Arenas, who lost millions of dollars in just a few days after starting up a high stakes poker game with some friends.

The risks associated with gambling addiction are clearly high, and they can lead to financial ruin, relationship problems and even criminal charges in some cases. It's important for athletes to be aware of the dangers of gambling addiction and to seek help if they feel like they might be struggling with it.
