#  Billions of dollars up for grabs in Missouri casino!

When Missouri voters approved a measure to allow casino gambling in the state, they could not have imagined the potential windfall for local governments. The November ballot measure authorized up to 24 casinos, including six in St. Louis County and four each in Kansas City and St. Joseph.

The potential for casino development has created a buzz among local officials who see the potential for new jobs and tax revenue. The Kansas City Star reported that developers are already proposing sites for casinos and that negotiations are underway for some of the licenses.

MoDOT urges caution while driving near work zones

The Missouri Department of Transportation is urging drivers to use caution while driving through work zones following an uptick in crashes. According to data from the department, there were 1,023 crashes in Missouri work zones during 2017, resulting in nine fatalities and 534 injuries.

“We want everyone traveling through our work zones to keep themselves and our workers safe,” said MoDOT Deputy Director Randy Luebkeman. “That means slowing down and paying attention – especially in inclement weather.”

Luebkeman noted that the number of crashes increased by about 10 percent from 2016 to 2017. In response, MoDOT is increasing its efforts to educate drivers about how to safely navigate work zones. These efforts include targeted advertising, social media outreach and updates on the department’s website.
