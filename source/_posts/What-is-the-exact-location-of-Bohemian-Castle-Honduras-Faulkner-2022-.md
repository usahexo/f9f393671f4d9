#  What is the exact location of Bohemian Castle Honduras Faulkner 2022? 
This is a question that has been puzzling many people since the discovery of this castle. Bohemian Castle Honduras Faulkner 2022 is located on the North shore of Roatan Island in the Bay Islands of Honduras. The Island is about 50 kilometers from the mainland and is part of the Islas de la Bahia National Park.

The Island was first inhabited by the Maya, who were later followed by the Spanish. The Island has a rich history and many different cultures have left their mark on it. The British pirate William Kidd even spent some time here.

The Castle was built in 1922 by American industrialist Edward H. Faulkner and served as his home until his death in 1947. It is said that Faulkner chose the location because it reminded him of his home in Bohemia. After Faulkner's death, the Castle passed through a number of different owners before being abandoned in 1974.

It was not until 2013 that the current owner, Jorge Gomez, discovered it and began restoration work. Gomez is a self-taught archeologist who has been restoring other historical sites on the island for many years. He plans to open the castle to the public once it is fully restored.

The castle is still undergoing restoration so there is not much to see yet, but it is definitely worth putting on your list of places to visit when you come to Roatan.
